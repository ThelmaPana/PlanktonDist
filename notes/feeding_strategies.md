# Feeding strategies âˆ’ Building the network

## Acantharea

**Mixotrophic**

- Decelle et al. 2013: Acantharia are known to ingest a wide range of prey, such as bacteria, microalgae and even zooplankton

- Swanberg and Caron, 1991: diatoms, eggs, protists, copepods, mollusc larvae, Acantharia

- Decelle 2015: mostly grazers, some species are mixotrophic (the case for our species)

- Suzuki 2015: mostly unknown, same as predators

## Actinopterygii

## Annelida

- Nival et al. 2019: Carnivorous

Poorly studied. 

## Appendicularia

## Aulacanthidae

## Chaetognatha

Ambush predators, mostly eat cladoceran and copepods, but also amphipods, krill and fish larvae. Feed also on younger chaetognaths.  Some species are omnivores (in the Arctic). 

- Pearre 1981

- Kruse 2018: copepods is the principal prey. Preyed-on by amphipods and fish. 

- Sullivan 1980: large variety of prey size, but prefer cyclopoid copepods (juveniles chaetognaths)

## Collodaria_colonial

**Mixotrophic**

- Decelle et al. 2012: Broad range of preys, including copepods, ciliates, phytoplankton (also Swanberg and Caron 1991)

## Collodaria_solitaryblack

**Mixotrophic**

Same as above. 

## Cop_Calanoida

## Cop_Calanus

## Cop_Euchaeta

## Cop_Euchaeta_juv

## Cop_Harpacticoida

## Cop_Heterorhabdus

## Cop_ogiverous

## Cop_Oithona

Omnivorous. 

## Cop_other

Unpsecified, likely omnivorous.

## Cop_Pleuromamma

## Cop_small

## Crustacea_other

Unpsecified, likely carnivorous. 

## Ctenophora

- Haddock 2007: deploy their two tentacles to catch preys, e.g. Copepoda. Carnivorous.

## Doliolida

- Conley et al. 2008: filter-feeder using mucous meshes.

- Clerc at al. 2023: various preys. Represented as non-selective feeders.

- Walters et al. 2018: wild-caught _Dolioletta gegenbauri_: Radiolaria, protists, chaetognaths, molluscs, copepods and Cnidaria

Preyed on by Sapphirina.


## Eumalacostraca

Likely carnivorous. 

## Hydrozoa

## Mollusca

Mostly pteropods, filter-feeders using mucous nets. 

## Pyrocystis

## Rhizaria

- Swanberg and Caron, 1991: diatoms, eggs, protists, copepods, mollusc larvae, Acantharia, Rhizaria

## Scyphozoa_ephyra

Carnivorous

## Siphonophorae

- Nival et al. 2019: predators of meso-zooplankton, ambush predator.
