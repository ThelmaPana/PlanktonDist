# PlanktonDist

Investigate what the distances between planktonic organisms can tell us about their ecology.

### Analyses

#### Steps

To detect patterns in distances between planktonic organisms, we need a null hypothesis: "planktonic organisms are randomly distributed". Null data is generated for this hypothesis, by generating random points within a set of images, so that the number of random points in images is representative of the number of planktonic organisms in images. Distances within ISIISâ€¯ data are then compared to null data to investigate the following points.

-   **overall** distances: if overall distances differ from what expected by the null data, this might reveal global interactions / non-randomness in plankton distribution.

-   **intrataxa** distances: if distances within a taxonomic group differ from what expected by the null data, this might reveal intrataxa interactions.

-   **intertaxa** distances: if distances between a pair of taxonomic groups differ from what expected by the null data, this might reveal intertaxa interactions.

#### Elements of discussion

Things to account for:

-   biological

    -   motility & trophic status

    -   division

    -   size of organisms

-   non-biological

    -   segmentation recall: 92% overall but vary between classes

    -   classification precision & recall + interclass confusions

    -   variations in environmental conditions

    -   variations in towing speed, i.e. pixel size in `x` axis can vary. We can use round solitary blacks to detect these changes.

    -   turbulence

    -   approximation of 3D distances (imaged volume) to 2D distances (image)
