Let’s use the agent-based model positions that are representative of plankton position and arbitrary remove some points to simulate lower recall, recompute distances and check if they are representative of overall distances.

```{r set_up}
#|cache: false
source("utils.R")
```

```{r}
load("data/simulation_results.Rdata")
```
